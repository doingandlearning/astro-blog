title: "What is in a newsletter?"

When starting to create content online and think about how to grow an audience and monetize, newsletters are touted as the best possible approach.

The argument goes that email has been around and will be around for a lot longer to come. You gain trust by being in someone’s inbox and stay top of mind.

I subscribe to a lot of newsletters and don’t always get round to reading them. Tonight I went through my unread emails and looked at each newsletter. I wondereed what the content was, what platform was being used and how the email started. I didn’t keep notes on those I decided to unsubscribe to.

As I join lists and consider how to improve mine, hopefully this will be a useful reference both for ideas and for inspiration. I was thinking about which emails I enjoy reading most - it really depends on my mood and current capacity. Sometimes, Chris Biscardi brief but insightful pieces are exactly what I need, others it is Packy McCormick’s longform and in depth reflections. Kent is linking out to his awesomely full blog and Colby is showing me all the great content he has produced this week.

One of the things I here a lot is that mailing lists/newsletters are great - that to build a content business and to sell online this is the way to go - build an audience … share stuff. I want to gather who I’m subscribed to and some observations about each of them.

This isn't really focused on what the newsletters are about but how they are structured and how I might learn from them.
