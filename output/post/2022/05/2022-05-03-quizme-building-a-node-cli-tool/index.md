I’m getting back into streaming once a week and I wasn’t sure what to start with. I put a poll out on Twitter and it came back.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Going to start streaming again tomorrow afternoon.<br><br>Wondering what to work on - what do you think?</p>— Kevin Cunningham (@dolearning) <a href="https://twitter.com/dolearning/status/1519582517556387841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2022</a></blockquote>

I ended up building a tool called `quizme` which is to help with spaced repetition and learning.

While I worked, I talked about a number of things:

- Setting up a project
- ESM and CommonJS
- process.argv
- Choosing a Node CLI library
- inquiry
- Parsing flags
- Reading and writing to files
- `#!` - the shebang or hashbang

There are lots of places to extend this application, [the code can be found here](https://github.com/doingandlearning/quizme).

I'm gradually going to add posts to look at each of the points above in more detail.
