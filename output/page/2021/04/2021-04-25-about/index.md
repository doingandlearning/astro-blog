I'm a web development consultant and educator working with people around the world from the shed in my office in rural Northern Ireland.

I started coding at 8 on my Spectrum 128k and have been attached to a computer ever since.

As a secondary school Maths teacher, I spent a decade making complex topics accessible. I used code to help my students in their learning and to speed up my own administration tasks.

I migrated to being a web developer and worked with clients from Sega to the British Library to small, emerging start-ups.

Now, I primarily teach development in a variety of live and pre-recorded ways.

I write and produce written and video content to help developers continually level up and not get stuck in "tutorial hell".

[I run workshops and training](/courses) to allow teams and individuals to rapidly upskill in new frameworks and approaches. I offer [1:1 mentoring and coaching](/mentoring) for developers looking for help taking their journey to the next level.

I also tweet, so [come follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dolearning).
