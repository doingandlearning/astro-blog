### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `BookCard.astro` and `BookCard.test.ts` in the same directory).
- Use `npm run test:run` to run all tests, `npm run test` for interactive mode, or `npm run test:ui` for the Vitest UI.
- **Content Collections**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Refactored to use Astro content collections instead of CSV processing
- **CSV Conversion**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Created utility to convert CSV to individual JSON files
- **Migration Script**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - `npm run convert-csv` converts existing CSV to content collection
- **Build Integration**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Books page now uses `getCollection("books")` for data
- LLM integration will be implemented as a build-time process to avoid runtime API calls.
- Testing is set up with Vitest and jsdom for component testing.
