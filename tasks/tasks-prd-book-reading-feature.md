# Task List: Book Reading Feature Implementation

## Relevant Files

- `src/pages/books.astro` - Main page for displaying the book reading collection
- `src/components/BookCard.astro` - Individual book display component with cover, title, author, and metadata
- `src/components/BookGrid.astro` - Responsive grid layout for displaying books
- `src/components/BookFilters.astro` - Filtering and search interface using Alpine.js
- `src/components/BookStats.astro` - Reading statistics and metrics display
- `src/scripts/processBooks.ts` - CSV processing and data validation utilities
- `src/scripts/enhanceCategorization.ts` - LLM integration for enhanced book categorization
- `src/types/books.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for book data structures
- `src/styles/books.css` - Specific styling for the book reading feature
- `public/data/books.csv` - CSV file containing book reading data
- `src/scripts/processBooks.test.ts` - Unit tests for CSV processing utilities
- `src/components/BookCard.test.ts` - Unit tests for BookCard component
- `src/components/BookGrid.test.ts` - Unit tests for BookGrid component

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `BookCard.astro` and `BookCard.test.ts` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- The CSV file will be placed in the public directory and processed during build time.
- LLM integration will be implemented as a build-time process to avoid runtime API calls.
