# Product Requirements Document: Book Reading Feature

## Introduction/Overview

This feature will create a dedicated page on the blog that showcases the blog owner's reading journey by automatically generating content from a CSV file containing book data. The CSV will be processed during the build process, eliminating the need for manual blog post creation for each book read. The feature will provide an engaging way for readers to discover the blog owner's literary interests and reading progress.

## Goals

1. **Automate Content Generation**: Automatically create a visually appealing book reading page from CSV data
2. **Enhance Blog Engagement**: Provide readers with an interesting way to discover the blog owner's reading habits
3. **Maintain Reading History**: Keep a comprehensive record of books read with key metadata
4. **Improve User Experience**: Create an intuitive and visually appealing interface for browsing books
5. **Enable Easy Updates**: Allow simple CSV updates to refresh the reading list without code changes

## User Stories

1. **As a blog owner**, I want to upload a CSV of my reading list so that my blog automatically displays my reading journey without manual intervention.

2. **As a blog reader**, I want to see what books the blog owner has read so that I can discover new reading recommendations and understand their literary interests.

3. **As a blog owner**, I want the system to automatically categorize and group my books so that readers can easily browse by genre, year, or other relevant criteria.

4. **As a blog reader**, I want to filter and search through the book collection so that I can find books that interest me specifically.

## Functional Requirements

1. **CSV Processing**: The system must read and parse a CSV file with the following fields: title, author, date finished, genre, pages, and cover URL.

2. **Data Validation**: The system must validate CSV data and handle missing or malformed entries gracefully (e.g., missing cover URLs, invalid dates).

3. **Book Display Grid**: The system must display books in a responsive grid layout showing book covers, titles, authors, and key metadata.

4. **Automatic Grouping**: The system must automatically group books by genre, year finished, and other logical categories.

5. **Smart Categorization**: The system must use an LLM to enhance book categorization beyond the basic genre field, providing more nuanced grouping options.

6. **Filtering and Search**: The system must allow users to filter books by genre, year, author, and search by title or author name.

7. **Responsive Design**: The system must provide an optimal viewing experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

8. **Build Integration**: The system must process the CSV during the build process and generate static content.

9. **Cover Image Handling**: The system must display book cover images from URLs, with fallback handling for broken or missing images.

10. **Reading Statistics**: The system must display aggregate statistics such as total books read, pages read, reading pace, and genre distribution.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Individual book review pages or detailed book content
- User authentication or personal reading lists for blog visitors
- Real-time CSV updates (only during build process)
- Social features like ratings or comments
- Integration with external book APIs or databases
- Advanced analytics or reading recommendations

## Design Considerations

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Book covers should be the primary visual element, with clear typography for titles and authors
- **Grid Layout**: Responsive grid that adapts to different screen sizes (3-4 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile)
- **Color Scheme**: Integrate with existing blog design while ensuring good contrast for readability
- **Typography**: Use clear, readable fonts for book information
- **Interactive Elements**: Subtle hover effects on book cards and smooth transitions for filtering
- **Loading States**: Graceful handling of image loading with placeholder states

## Technical Considerations

- **CSV Processing**: Use Node.js/JavaScript libraries for CSV parsing during build time
- **Image Optimization**: Implement lazy loading and responsive images for book covers
- **Performance**: Ensure the page loads quickly even with large numbers of books
- **SEO**: Implement proper meta tags and structured data for book information
- **Accessibility**: Ensure proper alt text for images and keyboard navigation support
- **LLM Integration**: Use OpenAI or similar service for enhanced book categorization
- **Build Process**: Integrate CSV processing into the existing Astro build pipeline

## Success Metrics

1. **Page Performance**: Page loads in under 3 seconds on average
2. **User Engagement**: Increased time spent on the book reading page compared to other blog pages
3. **Content Freshness**: Ability to update the reading list within 24 hours of CSV changes
4. **Visual Appeal**: Positive feedback on the book display layout and overall aesthetics
5. **Functionality**: All filtering and search features work correctly across different devices

## Open Questions

1. **LLM Service**: Which LLM service should be used for enhanced categorization, and what are the cost implications?
2. **CSV Update Frequency**: How often will the CSV be updated, and should there be a notification system for readers?
3. **Book Cover Quality**: What should be the fallback behavior for books without cover images?
4. **Genre Standardization**: Should the system attempt to standardize genre names (e.g., "Sci-Fi" vs "Science Fiction")?
5. **Performance Optimization**: What is the expected maximum number of books, and how should pagination be handled?
6. **Data Backup**: Should the CSV data be backed up or version controlled alongside the codebase?

## Implementation Notes

- The feature will be implemented as a new page in the existing Astro-based blog
- CSV processing will occur during the build process, not at runtime
- Book covers will be displayed using the existing image handling infrastructure
- The LLM categorization will be a build-time process to avoid runtime API calls
- All styling should follow the existing blog's design system and use Alpine.js for interactivity where possible
