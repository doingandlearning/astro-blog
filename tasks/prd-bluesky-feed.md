# Product Requirements Document: Bluesky Feed Integration

## Introduction/Overview

Add a Bluesky feed to the website that displays the user's recent Bluesky posts in a styled format that mimics the Bluesky interface. This feature will serve as a "microblog" section, showcasing recent thoughts and updates alongside the main blog content. The feed will be progressively enhanced - gathering posts during build time and allowing real-time refresh via JavaScript when users navigate to the page.

## Goals

1. **Display recent Bluesky content** - Show the latest 15-20 posts from the user's Bluesky account
2. **Maintain visual consistency** - Style posts to look like authentic Bluesky posts
3. **Progressive enhancement** - Start with build-time content gathering, enhance with real-time updates
4. **Seamless integration** - Integrate naturally with the existing site design and content flow
5. **Performance optimization** - Ensure the feed doesn't impact site load times

## User Stories

1. **As a website visitor**, I want to see the user's recent Bluesky posts so that I can stay updated on their latest thoughts and activities without leaving the site.

2. **As a Bluesky user**, I want to view the feed on the website so that I can see the content in context with the user's other work and potentially discover new posts.

3. **As a content creator**, I want my Bluesky posts to automatically appear on my website so that I can maintain a unified online presence without manual cross-posting.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Feed Display**: The system must display the latest 15-20 Bluesky posts in chronological order (newest first).

2. **Post Styling**: Each post must be styled to resemble an authentic Bluesky post, including:
   - Username and display name
   - Post timestamp
   - Post content (text)
   - Bluesky branding/visual elements

3. **Content Fetching**: The system must fetch Bluesky posts during the build process to ensure content is available immediately.

4. **Real-time Updates**: The system must provide JavaScript functionality to refresh the feed with the latest posts when users navigate to the page.

5. **Error Handling**: The system must display cached/last known content if Bluesky is unavailable or the feed fails to load.

6. **Responsive Design**: The feed must be fully responsive and work well on all device sizes.

7. **Performance**: The feed must load quickly and not significantly impact overall page performance.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **User Authentication**: Users will not be able to log into Bluesky through the website
- **Post Creation**: Users cannot create new Bluesky posts from the website
- **Direct Interaction**: Users cannot like, repost, or reply to posts directly on the website
- **Navigation Integration**: The feed will not be added to the main navigation at this time
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time webhook integration with Bluesky will be handled separately from this initial implementation
- **Historical Archive**: The feed will not provide access to posts older than the specified limit (15-20 posts)

## Design Considerations

- **Bluesky Post Styling**: Posts should visually match the Bluesky interface design
- **Typography**: Use appropriate font sizes and weights to match Bluesky's post styling
- **Spacing**: Maintain consistent spacing between posts and elements
- **Colors**: Incorporate Bluesky's color scheme where appropriate
- **Icons**: Use Bluesky-specific icons and visual elements
- **Layout**: Ensure posts flow naturally and are easy to scan

## Technical Considerations

- **Build-time Integration**: Use Astro's build process to fetch and cache Bluesky posts
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with static content, enhance with JavaScript for real-time updates
- **API Integration**: Integrate with Bluesky's API to fetch posts
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate caching to handle Bluesky API rate limits
- **Error Boundaries**: Gracefully handle API failures and display fallback content
- **Performance**: Optimize for Core Web Vitals and ensure the feed doesn't block page rendering

## Success Metrics

1. **Content Freshness**: Feed displays posts from within the last 24 hours
2. **Performance**: Feed loads within 2 seconds and doesn't impact overall page load time
3. **User Engagement**: Users spend time viewing the feed content
4. **Reliability**: Feed successfully loads content 95% of the time
5. **Visual Consistency**: Feed posts are visually indistinguishable from actual Bluesky posts

## Open Questions

1. **Bluesky API Access**: What are the current rate limits and authentication requirements for the Bluesky API?

2. **Content Filtering**: Should posts be filtered by content type (e.g., exclude reposts, only show original posts)?

3. **Update Frequency**: How often should the build-time fetching occur, and what's the optimal balance between freshness and build performance?

4. **Fallback Content**: What specific fallback content should be displayed when the feed fails to load?

5. **Real-time Implementation**: What's the preferred approach for implementing the JavaScript-based real-time updates?

6. **Bluesky Branding**: Are there specific guidelines or restrictions on how Bluesky content can be displayed on external websites?
