I don't know about you but I'm a big fan of file based routing. I enjoyed it in PHP and finding it in Next.js sped up my React development a lot. It has never been something I used in Express so when I moved to Fastify, I didn't even think it was an option. But it is and in this article, I want to show you how to set it up.

## What is file based routing?
Rather than creating a route file that we register with our application, we'll create a file in a certain directory structure. The name and location of the file will dictate the route. For example, a file named `routes.js` in the `routes/user` directory will create a route of `/user`. This is a simple example but we can also create nested routes by creating a file in a subdirectory. For example, a file named `routes.js` in the `routes/user/profile` directory will create a route of `/user/profile`.

## Setting up the project
For this example, I'm going to create a new Fastify project using the Fastify CLI. We'll use `npx` which is included with Node.js to run the Fastify CLI. 

```bash
npx fastify-cli generate file-based-routing --esm
```

This will create a new Fastify project in a directory named `file-based-routing`. The `--esm` flag tells the Fastify CLI to use ECMAScript modules. Like Node.js, Fastify supports both CommonJS and ECMAScript modules. I prefer ECMAScript modules so I'm using that here. The single line in the `package.json` file that tells Node.js to use ECMAScript modules is `"type": "module"`.

## Configuring the project

The good news is that the Fastify CLI has already set up file-based routing in the project for us. The `app.js` file is where we can see the configuration for our Fastify application. The `routes` directory is where we'll create our file based routes. The `plugins` directory is where we'll create our Fastify plugins.

If you are trying adding file based routing to an existing Fastify project, you'll need to make sure that the `@fastify/autoload` plugin is installed. This plugin will automatically load the routes from the `routes` directory. If it's not installed, you can install it using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install @fastify/autoload
```

or

```bash
yarn add @fastify/autoload
```

In the `app.js` file, we need to register the `@fastify/autoload` plugin. We can do this by importing the plugin and then calling the `register` method on our Fastify instance.

```javascript
import path from 'path'
import AutoLoad from '@fastify/autoload'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url'

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename)

export default async function (fastify, opts) {
  fastify.register(AutoLoad, {
    dir: path.join(__dirname, 'plugins'),
    options: Object.assign({}, opts)
  })
  fastify.register(AutoLoad, {
    dir: path.join(__dirname, 'routes'),
    options: Object.assign({prefix: "/api/v1/"}, opts)
  })
}
```

This assumes you're using ECMAScript modules. If you're using CommonJS modules, you'll need to use `require` instead of `import`. This is also assuming you're starting your server with the fastify-cli. If you're not, you'll need to instantiate your Fastify instance and register the plugin like this.

```javascript
import fastify from "fastify";
import autoLoad from "@fastify/autoload";
import path from "node:path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename)

const app = fastify({ logger: true });

app.register(autoLoad, {
  dir: join(__dirname, "routes"),
  dirNameRoutePrefix: true,
  options: {prefix: "/api/v1/"},
});

app.listen({ port: process.env.PORT, host: "0.0.0.0" }, (err, address) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  console.log(`Server listening at ${address}`);
});
```


## Creating the routes
The Fastify CLI creates a `routes` directory in the project. This is where we'll create our file based routes. Unlike other frameworks, the filename doesn't matter. We can name the file whatever we want. The directory structure is what matters.

The Fastify CLI creates a `root.js` file in the `routes` directory. This is a simple route that returns a JSON response. We can test that this route is working by running the Fastify server and checking. 

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now, point your browser at the URL in your terminal and you should get back a JSON response:

```json
{
  "root": true
}
```

There is also a folder called example with a file `index.js` in it. This is a nested route. The Fastify CLI has created this to show you how to create nested routes. If you navigate to `/example` in your browser, you should see the following text response:

```
this is an example
```

## Adding a new route (with a dynamic component)

Let's add a new route set to the project. We want to create CRUD routes for a users tasks.
 
First, we'll create some nested folders - user/:id/tasks.

![Screenshot of the folder structure](https://res.cloudinary.com/kc-cloud/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/raycast-uploads/mbwq5ipvxmb2v0vnhdm5)

and add a file named `routes.js` in the `tasks` folder. This will create a route of `/user/:id/tasks`.

![Screenshot of the file](https://res.cloudinary.com/kc-cloud/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/raycast-uploads/wzyay3ushaqdu1unqbcc)

The filename doesn't matter remember, just the directory. I call the file `routes.js` if I want it to handle multiple HTTP methods and URIs. If I want it to handle a single HTTP method or URI, I'll name the file `index.js` or something meaningful.

In the `routes.js` folder we'll add the following code:

```javascript
export default async function (fastify, opts) {
  fastify.post("/", async function (request, reply) {});
  fastify.get("/", async function (request, reply) {});
  fastify.get("/:resourceId", async function (request, reply) {});
  fastify.patch("/:resourceId", async function (request, reply) {});
  fastify.delete("/:resourceId", async function (request, reply) {});
}
```

This is the order I like to write my routes in - it follows the CRUD pattern. You can write your routes in any order you like.

## Accessing the dynamic component

In the `routes.js` file, we have a route of `/user/:id/tasks/:resourceId`. We can access the `id` and `resourceId` parameters using the `request.params` object.

```javascript
fastify.get("/:resourceId", async function (request, reply) {
	const { id, resourceId } = request.params;
	reply.send({ id, resourceId });
});
```

This will return a JSON response with the `id` and `resourceId` parameters. Note that the `id` parameter is available because the directory name (`:id`). The `resourceId` parameter is available because it's in the route URI. Both are available in the `request.params` object.

## Conclusion

File based routing is a great way to organize your routes. It's especially useful when you have a lot of routes. It's also a great way to keep your routes close to the code that they're handling. This can make it easier to maintain your code and understand what's happening. I hope this article has shown you how to set up file based routing in Fastify.
