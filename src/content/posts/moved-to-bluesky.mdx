import {BlueskyPost} from 'astro-embed';

To be honest, I've struggled to engage well on social media for a few years now. Even though Twitter has been a source of some great friendships, career opportunties and learning moments, it got harder and harder to find the good stuff.

Between ads, the algorithm and a sense of general negativity - I found myself over there less and less. 

I signed up for Mastodon and Bluesky over a year ago - in the hopes of finding a new home but it was hard to get into the habit. 

Last week, a whole host of my favourite people moved to Bluesky and I logged back in again. Immediately, it felt like a breath of fresh air.

I'm not sure if it's the newness of the platform, the lack of ads or the fact that I'm following seeing the posts of just the people I follow - but I'm loving it. There is more conversation and discussion and less of the performative stuff that I've grown tired of.

If you want to join me, you can find me at [@dolearning.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/dolearning.dev). I'm looking forward to seeing you there! 

While I'm here I want to try an Astro Bluesky embed component:
