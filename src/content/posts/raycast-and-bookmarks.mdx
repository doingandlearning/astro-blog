import Precheck from "../../components/Precheck.astro";

I have been trying to find ways to share the things I'm reading in a helpful way. I also know that not everything I read and want to share deserves a whole blogpost. 

I've used lots of different tools over the years but in a move to own my data I've been trying to find a way to collect bookmarks myself and then share them on my site.

I've been using [Raycast](https://raycast.com) for a while now and I love it. It's a great way to quickly access all the tools I use on a daily basis. I'm going to explain how I created a Raycast extension to collect bookmarks in the form and place I need it.

<Precheck>
- Raycast is installed
- You have a Raycast account
- Read and understand some TypeScript
</Precheck>

## Creating a Raycast Extension

Raycast extensions are written in TypeScript and are run in a Node environment. You can find the [documentation here](https://developers.raycast.com/).

With Raycast installed you can run the command `create extension`. This will run you through a wizard to create a new extension.

I'm created a new extension called `Bookmark Gatherer` and I'm used the `Form` template.

## Open the project

Find the folder you initialised the project in. Now, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will install all the dependencies and start the development server. You can run your command through Raycast already and see the logs in the terminal.

All of the work we are going to do is in the `index.tsx` file. This is the entry point for the extension.

Opening it up, we'll see that it is a React component. We can use all the React goodness we want to create our extension.


The full file can be found [here](https://github.com/doingandlearning/raycast-bookmark-gatherer/blob/main/src/index.tsx).


### Setup and Dependencies

```tsx
import { Form, ActionPanel, Action, showToast, Clipboard, getPreferenceValues, closeMainWindow, popToRoot } from "@raycast/api";
import { useEffect, useState, useRef } from "react";
import axios from "axios"
import { load } from "cheerio";
import fs from "node:fs"
import path from "node:path"
```

The first section of the file contains the import statements. These are used to import the necessary modules and libraries for the component. Let's go through each import statement and explain its purpose.

- `Form`, `ActionPanel`, `Action`, `showToast`, `Clipboard`, `getPreferenceValues`, `closeMainWindow`, `popToRoot`: These are all imported from the `@raycast/api` module. They are used to create the form and handle form submission. The `showToast` function is used to display error messages.  
- `useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`: These are imported from the `react` module. They are used to create state variables and effect hooks. We'll discuss these in more detail later.
- `axios` and `cheerio` are used to get the page content from the bookmark and extract the title.
- `fs` and `path` are used to save the bookmark data to a file.


I tried to implement this using just Node core modules but it made the code a bit too messy. Using these two libraries makes it much easier to get the data we need. You will need to install them though:

```bash
npm install cheerio axios
```

### Component Structure
We can now look at the component structure. The component is a functional component, which means it is a function that returns JSX. The component is called `Command` and it takes no arguments. The component is exported as the default export of the file.

```tsx
export default function Command() {}
```

At the top of the component we define the state variables. These are used to store the data from the form. We have a state variable for the URL, title, loading state, and custom tags. 

We initialise the URL, the customTags and title to empty strings. We initialise the loading state to `true`.

React returns an array that we destructure into the state variables getter and setter. 

```tsx
const [url, setUrl] = useState("");
const [title, setTitle] = useState("");
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
const [customTags, setCustomTags] = useState("");
```

Next, we define the `descriptionRef` ref. A ref is a way to access a DOM element in React. We'll use this to focus on the description field once the loading is complete.

```tsx
const descriptionRef = useRef(null);
```

### The form

Let's look at the form itself. The form is wrapped in a `Form` component. The `Form` component takes a `actions` prop, which is a JSX element. This is used to render the actions at the bottom of the form. We're only going to have one action, which is the submit button.

```tsx
return (
  <Form
    isLoading={isLoading}
    actions={
      <ActionPanel>
        <Action.SubmitForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
      </ActionPanel>
    }
    initialFocus="description"
  >
    <Form.Description text="Bookmark Gatherer" />
    <Form.TextField id="url" title="URL" placeholder="URL" value={url} onChange={setUrl} />
    <Form.TextField id="title" title="Title" placeholder="Title" value={title} onChange={setTitle} />
    <Form.TextArea id="description" title="Description" placeholder="What did you find compelling or intriguing about this?" ref={descriptionRef} />
    <Form.TextField
      id="customTags"
      title="Custom Tags"
      placeholder="Enter custom tags separated by comma or space"
      value={customTags}
      onChange={setCustomTags}
    />
  </Form>
);
```

We are using the `Form.Description` component to display the title of the form. This is a simple text component that takes a `text` prop.

Next, we have two `Form.TextField` components. These are used to collect the URL and title. Each component takes an `id`, `title`, `placeholder`, `value`, and `onChange` prop. The `id` is used to identify the field. The `title` is used to display the title of the field. The `placeholder` is used to display placeholder text in the field. The `value` is used to set the value of the field. The `onChange` is used to set the value of the field when it changes.

The `Form.TextArea` component is used to collect the description. It takes the same props as the `Form.TextField` component. We also pass the `descriptionRef` ref to the `ref` prop. This is used to focus on the description field once the loading is complete.

The last `Form.TextField` component is used to collect custom tags. It takes the same props as the other `Form.TextField` components.

The action panel is rendered at the bottom of the form. It contains the submit button. The `Action.SubmitForm` component is used to render the submit button. It takes an `onSubmit` prop, which is a function that is called when the form is submitted.

### The handleSubmit function

```tsx
function handleSubmit(values: Values) {
  if (!values.url) {
    return
  }
  try {
    const tagsArray = values.customTags!.split(/,|\s+/).filter(tag => tag.trim() !== "")
    delete values.customTags;
    saveDataToFile({ ...values, tags: tagsArray, date: new Date() });
    popToRoot()
    closeMainWindow({ clearRootSearch: true });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error)
    showToast({ title: 'Error', message: 'Something went wrong' });
  }
}
```

The `handleSubmit` function is called when the form is submitted. It takes a `values` argument, which is an object containing the values from the form. The function first checks if the URL is empty. If it is, it returns and does nothing.

Next, the function splits the `customTags` value into an array. It then deletes the `customTags` property from the `values` object. This is because the customTags field is not part of the bookmark data.

The function then calls the `saveDataToFile` function, passing in the `values` object. It then calls the `popToRoot` function, which closes the form and returns to the main window. Finally, it calls the `closeMainWindow` function, which closes the main window.

## The saveDataToFile function

```tsx
function saveDataToFile(data) {
  const preferences = getPreferenceValues();
  const saveDirectory = preferences.saveDirectory || process.env.HOME; // Fallback to home directory

  const filePath = path.join(saveDirectory, 'raycast-bookmarks.json'); // Save file in home directory
  fs.readFile(filePath, (err, fileData) => {
    let bookmarks = [];
    if (!err) {
      bookmarks = JSON.parse(fileData.toString());
    }
    bookmarks.push(data);
    fs.writeFile(filePath, JSON.stringify(bookmarks, null, 2), (writeErr) => {
      if (writeErr) {
        showToast({ title: 'Error', message: 'Failed to save data' });
      }
    });
  });
}
```

The `saveDataToFile` function is used to save the bookmark data to a file. It takes a `data` argument, which is the bookmark data. The function first gets the preferences using the `getPreferenceValues` function. It then gets the `saveDirectory` from the preferences. If the `saveDirectory` is not set, it falls back to the home directory.

Next, the function creates the file path using the `path.join` function. It then reads the file using the `fs.readFile` function. If there is an error, it sets the `bookmarks` variable to an empty array. If there is no error, it parses the file data and sets the `bookmarks` variable to the parsed data.

The function then pushes the `data` argument to the `bookmarks` array. It then writes the `bookmarks` array to the file using the `fs.writeFile` function. If there is an error, it displays an error message using the `showToast` function.

## fetchTitle

```tsx
  const fetchTitle = async (url: string) => {
    try {
      const { data } = await axios.get(url);
      const $ = load(data);
      const title = $('head title').text();
      setTitle(title);
    } catch (error) {
      showToast({ title: "Error", message: "Could not fetch the website title" });
    }
  };
```

The `fetchTitle` function is used to fetch the title of the bookmark. It takes a `url` argument, which is the URL of the bookmark. The function first tries to fetch the data from the URL using the `axios.get` function. It then loads the data using the `load` function from the `cheerio` library. It then uses the `text` function to get the title from the data. Finally, it sets the title using the `setTitle` function.

If there is an error, it displays an error message using the `showToast` function.

## useEffect to fill field from the clipboard

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  Clipboard.readText().then((clipboardText) => {
    if (clipboardText && clipboardText.startsWith("http")) {
      setUrl(clipboardText);
      fetchTitle(clipboardText);
    }
    setIsLoading(false);
  });
}, []);
```

The `useEffect` hook is used to fill the URL and title fields from the clipboard. It takes a function as the first argument and an array as the second argument. The function is called when the component is mounted. The array is used to specify the dependencies of the effect. If the array is empty, the effect is only called when the component is mounted.

The function first calls the `Clipboard.readText` function to read the clipboard text. It then checks if the clipboard text is not empty and starts with `http`. If it is, it sets the URL using the `setUrl` function. It then calls the `fetchTitle` function, passing in the clipboard text.

The function then sets the loading state to `false` using the `setIsLoading` function.

## useEffect for the url changing

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (url) {
    fetchTitle(url);
  }
}, [url]);
```

The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch the title when the URL changes. It takes a function as the first argument and an array as the second argument. The function is called when the URL changes. The array is used to specify the dependencies of the effect. If the array contains the URL, the effect is called when the URL changes.

The function first checks if the URL is not empty. If it is not empty, it calls the `fetchTitle` function, passing in the URL.

## useEffect for the loading state

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isLoading) {
    (descriptionRef.current)?.focus();
  }
}, [isLoading]);
```

This `useEffect` hook is used to focus on the description field when the loading state changes. It takes a function as the first argument and an array as the second argument. The function is called when the loading state changes. The array is used to specify the dependencies of the effect. If the array contains the loading state, the effect is called when the loading state changes.

The function first checks if the loading state is `false`. If it is, it calls the `focus` function on the `descriptionRef` ref.

## Allow the user to set a save directory

To allow the user to set a save directory, we need to add a preference to the `package.json` file. 

```json
  "preferences": [
    {
      "name": "saveDirectory",
      "title": "Save Directory",
      "type": "textfield",
      "description": "In which directory should the bookmarks be saved?",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
```

By adding this preference, the user will be able to set a save directory in the preferences of the extension. The required property is set to true, which means the user will have to set a save directory before they can use the extension.

This tutorial has covered the basics of creating a Raycast extension. We've covered the basics of creating a form, handling form submission, and saving data to a file. We've also covered how to use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from the clipboard and focus on the description field when the loading state changes.

You can see the results of formatted output of this on my [bookmarks page](/bookmarks).

I'll talk about the Astro component I used to display the bookmarks in a future post.
