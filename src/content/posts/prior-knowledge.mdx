When we create educational materials, it is impossible to write for everyone. As with all types of writing, we must consider our audience. However, in the case of educational materials, we must also consider the prior knowledge of our audience. This is because prior knowledge plays a significant role in learning. It influences how we process new information and how we make sense of it. 

If we don't do this, we can alienate our audience. We can make them feel like they are not smart enough to understand or that they are not welcome. 

I want to think about why we should recognise and activate prior learnin

1. **Introduction:**
   - Start by highlighting the common issue in educational materials, particularly tutorials, where the prior knowledge of learners is often overlooked.
   - Explain briefly why this oversight can be detrimental to the learning process.

2. **Understanding Prior Knowledge:**
   - Define what prior knowledge is and its role in learning.
   - Discuss how prior knowledge influences new learning experiences and the comprehension of new information.

3. **The Problem in Current Tutorials:**
   - Provide examples or scenarios where tutorials assume a level of prior knowledge that may not be present.
   - Discuss the consequences, such as learner frustration, demotivation, or the perpetuation of knowledge gaps.

4. **Reasons for the Oversight:**
   - Analyze why tutorial creators often overlook prior knowledge. Consider factors like assumptions about the target audience, constraints in tutorial design, or the expertise bias (where experts assume certain knowledge is universal).

5. **The Importance of Acknowledging Prior Knowledge:**
   - Argue why recognizing prior knowledge is crucial in educational materials.
   - Cite research or theories that support the need for tailoring learning experiences to the learner’s existing knowledge base.

6. **A Proposed Solution – A New Component:**
   - Introduce a component or framework that can be integrated into future tutorials to ensure they consider prior knowledge.
   - Describe how this component works, its benefits, and how it can be practically implemented.

7. **Case Studies or Examples:**
   - If possible, provide examples where this component has been applied or how it could transform a typical tutorial scenario.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize the key points made in the article.
   - Emphasize the potential positive impact on learning outcomes when prior knowledge is considered.
   - Encourage educators, instructional designers, and content creators to adopt this new approach.

Remember to include citations of relevant research and theories to strengthen your arguments. Also, keeping the tone informative yet engaging will help in conveying your message effectively to your audience.

                      The web is still a very young medium, and it has been influenced more than anything else by print media design. There is so much more that can be done with text on a screen than is being done today. Citations, drawing, chat, speech-to-text. There are opportunities everywhere, and the bar is low! If we are serious about unlocking the value of knowledge we should consider how to improve every part of the knowledge production stack, and that includes reading. As Laurel Schwulst says: “Imaginative functionality is important, even if it’s only a trace of what was, as it’s still a sketch for a more ideal world.”
