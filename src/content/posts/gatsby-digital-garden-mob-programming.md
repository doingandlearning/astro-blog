[Last week](/posts/yak-shaving/), I mentioned I'd been inspired by Maggie and Ian's  
and was attempting to build a file based wiki that is compiled by Gatsby.

I managed to get the first version of my prototype [out](/wiki) and Ian got his first version of [his version](https://www.ianjones.us/notes/digital-garden) of notes out this week as well.

Tomorrow evening (27th April) at 7pm BST (other timezones are available) we're going to be getting together and live streaming along with [Will](https://twitter.com/willjohnsonio/). The aim is to extract what we've got so far into a reusable theme for anyone else to use. Anyone who might be interested in planting and growing their own digital garden in a similar way will have a better launching off point.

Come along, jump on the chat and help us make it as good as it can be. I've heard rumours of some serious design support as well, so that'll help me!

[Sign up here](https://egghead.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_oa6DPjC6Qkmh81dGjqmbHw/).

I'll post about what came out of it during the week.
