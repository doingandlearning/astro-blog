In his latest email, Kamran Ayub pointed out that long tutorials can be unhelpful for neuro-diverse readers. He mentioned having ways to keep track and gamify the process can be helpful.

I recently moved this site to Astro and was super impressed with their tutorial system. I'm going to try to implement some of those elements here.

## Precheck

This is a component that Astro uses to show required knowledge. I think this is super helpful and can be used to link to other relevant tutorials.

<Precheck>
	- [ ] Know some CSS
	- [ ] Know some HTML
</Precheck>

## Multiple Choice

Having quizzes throughout the article or at the end can be a good way to check for understanding. 

<Box icon="question-mark">
1. Who are these section useful for?

    <MultipleChoice>
      <Option>
        Neurotypical people
      </Option>
      <Option>
        Neurodiverse people
      </Option>
      <Option isCorrect>
        Everyone
      </Option>
    </MultipleChoice>
</Box>

## Tracking progress

The Astro docs use localStorage for this which I think is a good idea. I'll have a look at that one in a later article.

I want to call out that I'm using and adapting the work of the Astro team within the terms of their license. I plan on making these components even more my own over time but I wanted to give credit where credit is due. 

The multiple choice component above is an example of a HTML Web Component and I want to explain and explore that in more detail soon.
