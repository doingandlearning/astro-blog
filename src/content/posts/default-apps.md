description: "Following a blogging trend thinking about default apps"
---

As I've been trying to make my blog and site a bit more useful and accessible, I've been scouring other blogs. I think that personal websites are some of the more exciting bits of the web at the moment.

On a few of the blogs I follow, there's been a trend in listing default apps. I've seen this on [Matt Birchler](https://birchtree.me/blog/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023/) and [Kev Quirk's](https://kevquirk.com/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023) blogs

These things change, so it'll be fun to see what's stuck when I look back later.
