I've got it into my head that I want to build a pen plotter. I think they are very cool and I'm conscious that I'd like to have some more physical hobbies. Things I'm hoping to get out of this project:

- A physical project I can explore generative art with
- Some bonding time with my eldest
- More confidence in bringing physical ideas into being
- Fuel for ideas both physical and digital 

I spent some time reading through [Instructables](https://instructables.com) and read through a lot of the material on [Drawing Bots](https://drawingbots.net) website. I joined that Discord and asked some questions.

I couldn't decide initially whether I should buy a kit or try to build this myself. Encouraged by the Discord, I decided to follow the adventue and build myself. Most of the tutorials and guides I've found suggested using an Ardunio Uno and a motor shield - I've done some work with Ardunio before and this seemed sensible but a Discord member had a different idea:

> Better get any 3d printer board and use that instead

In retrospect, this seems so obvious I feel silly for not thinking about this myself but this is a learning journey so here I go. I have a list of parts also known as "Bill of Materials" or BOM and here's what it looks like right now:

| Item                           | Qty | Unit Price | Total        |
| ------------------------------ | --- | ---------- | ------------ |
| SKR Mini E3 V3.0 board         | 1   | £45        | £45          |
| NEMA 17 stepper motors         | 2   | £12        | £24          |
| SG90 Micro Servo               | 1   | £9         | £9           |
| 12 V ATX PSU (reused/spare)    | 1   | £0–20      | \~£10        |
| V-slot, rods, pulleys, belts   | —   | —          | £30          |
| 3D-print filament + misc parts | —   | —          | £15          |
| **Total**                      | —   |            | **£130–140** |

I don't know how realistic those numbers are and I don't know how to make this thing but I'm keen to give it a go. Alongside those, I'll need to use my 3D printer to get some of the parts like the pen holder and then I'll need to work out how to code it all. I'm less nervous about those parts as I understand them better.

There's a line on there that looks ambigious and impenetrable - the one about pulleys and rods and things - I don't know where to start there.
