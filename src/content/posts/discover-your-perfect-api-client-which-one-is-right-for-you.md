API testing tools are essential for modern development, but finding the right one can be challenging. While Postman has become the de facto standard, it's become increasingly bloated and resource-heavy. In this comprehensive comparison, we'll explore lightweight alternatives that might be perfect for your workflow.

## Overview

We'll compare six different API testing approaches and tools:

1. Browser-based testing
2. VS Code Thunder Client plugin
3. Bruno
4. Firecamp
5. Hoppscotch
6. Yaak

Each tool has its strengths and ideal use cases, so let's dive in and find your perfect match.

## 1. Browser-based Testing

### Using Browser Developer Tools

The simplest approach - using your browser's developer tools:

```javascript
// Making API calls directly in browser console
fetch('https://api.example.com/users', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-token-here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

**Pros:**
- No installation required
- Perfect for quick tests
- Built into every browser

**Cons:**
- Limited organization
- No collection management
- Difficult to share with team

## 2. VS Code Thunder Client

A lightweight REST API client extension for Visual Studio Code.

### Getting Started

1. Install the Thunder Client extension
2. Open the Thunder Client tab
3. Create new requests directly in VS Code

**Key Features:**
- Git-friendly JSON format
- Environment variables support
- Collection organization
- Code generation

**Pros:**
- Integrates with your development environment
- Version control friendly
- Lightweight and fast
- No separate application needed

**Cons:**
- VS Code only
- Limited collaboration features
- Basic UI compared to dedicated tools

### Example Collection Structure

```json
{
  "client": "Thunder Client",
  "collectionName": "User API",
  "dateCreated": "2024-01-12",
  "requests": [
    {
      "name": "Get Users",
      "url": "{{baseUrl}}/users",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": [
        {
          "name": "Authorization",
          "value": "Bearer {{token}}"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

}

get {
  url: {{host}}/api/users
  body: none
  auth: none
}

headers {
  Authorization: Bearer {{authToken}}

# Pick a Lean API Client: The Right Tool for Your Workflow

> This post pairs with the video: [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0p5lOS6se0)

Modern API work shouldn’t require a 1GB electron behemoth. If Postman feels heavy for your day-to-day, here are lighter options that cover 90% of use-cases with a fraction of the overhead.

---

## TL;DR — Quick Picks

- **Live in VS Code?** Use **Thunder Client**.
- **Git/native, offline, no cloud?** Use **Bruno**.
- **Web-first & multi-protocol (REST/GraphQL/WebSocket/MQTT)?** Use **Hoppscotch**.
- **Team collaboration & real-time?** Use **Firecamp**.
- **Minimal native desktop?** Use **Yaak**.
- **One-off checks?** Use **Browser DevTools** (or `curl`).

## What we’ll compare

Six approaches/tools:

1. Browser DevTools
2. Thunder Client (VS Code)
3. Bruno
4. Firecamp
5. Hoppscotch
6. Yaak

Each section covers when to use it, why it’s good, and trade-offs.

---

## Decision Helper (30 seconds)

- **Need collections versioned in Git with no cloud** → **Bruno** or **Thunder Client**  
- **Need multi-protocol + browser access** → **Hoppscotch**  
- **Need real-time collaboration** → **Firecamp**  
- **Want the simplest, fastest native app** → **Yaak**  
- **Just sanity-check an endpoint** → **Browser DevTools**

---

## 1) Browser DevTools

**Best for:** Instant checks and debugging CORS/auth in the context of your web app.

```js
// Quick test in the console
fetch('{{ BASE_URL }}/users', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer {{ TOKEN }}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
````

**Pros:** zero install, always there, great for quick calls.
**Cons:** poor organization, no shareable collections, limited teamwork.

---

## 2) Thunder Client (VS Code)

**Best for:** VS Code users who want requests next to their code, stored in Git.

**Highlights**

* Collections live as JSON in your repo
* Environments & variables
* Basic test scripting, codegen, small footprint

**Trade-offs**

* VS Code only
* Collaboration = Git PRs, not real-time

**Example request (JSON file)**

```json
{
  "client": "Thunder Client",
  "collectionName": "User API",
  "requests": [
    {
      "name": "Get Users",
      "url": "{{ BASE_URL }}/users",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": [{ "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer {{ TOKEN }}" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 3) Bruno

**Best for:** Offline-first, Git-native collections, no vendor lock-in.

**Highlights**

* Files on disk, great diffs in PRs
* Pre/post request scripts
* Multiple environments
* Open source; privacy-friendly

**Trade-offs**

* Custom syntax to learn
* Fewer out-of-the-box integrations

**Example `.bru`**

```
meta {
  name: User Management
  type: http
}

get {
  url: {{ HOST }}/api/users
  body: none
}

headers {
  Authorization: Bearer {{ TOKEN }}
  Content-Type: application/json
}

script:pre-request {
  // Example: set a timestamp variable
  bru.setVar("timestamp", Date.now());
}
```

---

## 4) Firecamp

**Best for:** Teams needing real-time collaboration and multi-protocol testing.

**Highlights**

* Live collaboration on requests
* REST, GraphQL, WebSockets
* Doc generation from collections

**Trade-offs**

* Cloud-centric workflow
* Advanced features may require paid plans

---

## 5) Hoppscotch

**Best for:** Web/PWA experience with broad protocol coverage.

**Highlights**

* Runs in the browser (can install as PWA)
* REST, GraphQL, WebSocket, MQTT
* Clean UI, open source

**Trade-offs**

* Works best online
* Enterprise features lighter than dedicated desktop apps

**CLI sample**

```bash
npx @hoppscotch/cli test ./collection.json --env ./environment.json
```

---

## 6) Yaak

**Best for:** A fast, minimal desktop client that focuses on the core loop.

**Highlights**

* Native-feeling, distraction-free
* Variables, collections, codegen
* Cross-platform desktop

**Trade-offs**

* Smaller ecosystem
* Fewer advanced/enterprise features

## Choosing by Use-Case

**Solo devs**

* Speedy checks → **Browser DevTools**
* VS Code workflow → **Thunder Client**
* Privacy/offline/versioned → **Bruno**

**Small teams**

* Git-based review of requests → **Bruno** or **Thunder Client**
* Web-first, multi-protocol → **Hoppscotch**
* Real-time pairing & demos → **Firecamp**

**Larger teams**

* Collaboration & shared workspaces → **Firecamp**
* Git-centric migration from Postman → **Bruno**
* Mixed stacks/protocols, low install friction → **Hoppscotch**

---

## Migration from Postman (safe path)

1. **Export** Postman collections and environments.
2. **Import** into your target tool (most support Postman formats).
3. **Map variables**:

   * `{{ PLACEHOLDER }}` names stay consistent across tools.
   * Keep secrets in `.env` or your secret manager; do not commit.
4. **Restructure**:

   * Group requests by service and environment.
   * Add minimal docs/notes per request.
5. **Automate**:

   * Add a CI lint step to validate collection JSON (where supported).
   * Treat changes like code (PRs + review comments).

**Suggested repo layout**

```
/api/
  /collections/
    users.bru
    billing.bru
  /env/
    dev.env
    staging.env
    prod.env
```

---

## Best Practices that Pay Off

* **One collection per service**; short, task-named requests.
* **Environments** for `dev/staging/prod`; keep tokens as secrets.
* **Pre-request scripts** for auth/nonce/timestamps; cut repetition.
* **Docs inline**: short notes explaining intent and expected responses.
* **Review like code**: diffs in PRs, not screenshots in chat.

---

## Try This Next

1. Pick **two** candidates that match your context (e.g., **Bruno** + **Thunder Client**).
2. Recreate a small slice of your current Postman workflow.
3. Commit collections; open a PR; review diffs/ergonomics with a teammate.
4. Standardize on the better fit; migrate gradually.
