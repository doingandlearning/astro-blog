We ship features, but we run systems. Architecture connects the two. Here’s a concise field guide to four fundamentals you’ll use on every project.

---

## The 4 Fundamentals (and how to apply them)

### 1) Architectural Characteristics (the non-functional drivers)

These shape everything else. Pick a few that truly matter for your context and *make them measurable*.

| Characteristic | Typical Metric (example) |
|---|---|
| Performance | p95 latency ≤ [PLACEHOLDER] ms |
| Scalability | Sustains [PLACEHOLDER]x traffic with ≤ [PLACEHOLDER]% error rate |
| Reliability | SLO: 99.9% success; MTTR < [PLACEHOLDER] mins |
| Security | Zero critical vulns; least-privilege access reviews quarterly |
| Maintainability/Evolvability | Lead time < [PLACEHOLDER] days; change failure rate < [PLACEHOLDER]% |
| Operability/Observability | Alerting on SLO burn; logs + traces for critical paths |

**Use:** Write 3–5 targets, review them before big design choices, and test against them in CI or load tests.

---

### 2) Architectural Decisions (make trade-offs explicit)

Bias to **reversible** choices early; document the rest with lightweight ADRs.

**Minimal ADR template:**
````md
# ADR [NUMBER]: [DECISION]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR [N]

## Context
What problem are we solving? Constraints? (e.g., latency SLO, team size)

## Options
- Option A: [PLACEHOLDER]
- Option B: [PLACEHOLDER]

## Decision
We chose [OPTION].

## Consequences
Positive: [PLACEHOLDER]
Negative (risks/debt): [PLACEHOLDER]
````

**Good practice**

* Record *why not chosen* for major options.
* Link ADRs to tickets and docs.
* Revisit when assumptions change (new scale, new team, new SLOs).

---

### 3) Logical Components (boundaries before boxes)

Decompose by **business capability** first; keep components highly cohesive and loosely coupled.

**Checklist**

* Clear purpose in one sentence.
* API/contract defined (inputs, outputs, errors, SLAs).
* No bidirectional dependencies.
* Data ownership is explicit.
* Observability baked in (logs, metrics, traces).

**Example decomposition (e-commerce)**

* Catalog (owns products)
* Ordering (owns orders)
* Payments (owns payments, talks to PSP)
* Fulfillment (owns shipments)

---

### 4) Architectural Styles (choose by constraint, not fashion)

Start simple; evolve when signals appear.

| Style                            | What it is                                      | Use when                                          | Watch out for                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Layered Monolith**             | One deployable, clear layers (UI, domain, data) | Small team, fast iteration                        | Hidden coupling, “ball of mud” without module boundaries      |
| **Modular Monolith**             | One deployable, strong module boundaries        | Need domain boundaries + easy ops                 | Enforce boundaries (linters/CI) or they erode                 |
| **Microservices**                | Many small, independently deployable services   | Team autonomy + wildly different scaling profiles | Distributed complexity, eventual consistency, higher ops cost |
| **Event-Driven**                 | Async via events/queues                         | Loose coupling, audit trails, integrations        | Debugging flows; need idempotency and schema governance       |
| **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)** | Domain core decoupled from I/O                  | Testability, multiple adapters (DBs, queues)      | Over-abstracting when scope is tiny                           |
| **Serverless**                   | Functions + managed services                    | Spiky traffic, minimal ops                        | Cold starts, local dev friction                               |

**Evolution path**

* From *monolith* to *modular monolith* to *microservices* when you see: team bottlenecks, divergent scaling, or change blasts across modules.

## Putting it together (quick workflow)

1. **Define 3–5 characteristics** with targets.
2. **Sketch components** by capability; write contracts.
3. **Choose style** that best satisfies step 1 with least complexity.
4. **Capture decisions** with ADRs.
5. **Prove it**: add load tests/chaos drills against your targets.
6. **Evolve** when pain signals persist after local fixes.

---

## Common pitfalls (and fixes)

* Accidental complexity > essential complexity → **Start with a modular monolith.**
* Hand-wavy “ilities” → **Quantify SLOs and test them.**
* Tribal knowledge → **ADRs + diagrams-as-code in repo.**
* Tight coupling via database sharing → **Private data per component; communicate via APIs/events.**
* Over-engineered abstractions → **YAGNI; prefer reversible decisions.**

---

## Key Takeaways

* Let **business characteristics** drive structure and tech.
* Make **trade-offs explicit** with ADRs.
* Design **cohesive components** with clear ownership.
* **Pick the simplest style** that meets your targets; evolve deliberately.

---

## Next Steps

* Identify and measure 3–5 characteristics for your current system.
* Add an `/adr` folder and write ADR 000: “Record architecture decisions”.
* Map your system into 4–8 components with owners and contracts.
* Run a lightweight load test against your SLO targets.
