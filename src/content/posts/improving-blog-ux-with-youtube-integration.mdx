# Improving Blog UX with YouTube Integration and Enhanced Date Display

**TL;DR**  
I added a YouTube feed, showed both **Published** and **Updated** dates, and sorted posts by their most recent change. Readers now find fresher content faster, and videos and posts live in one place.

---

## Why change?

- My YouTube videos lived separately from the blog.  
- Updated articles stayed buried.  
- Dates were vague (“2 years ago” only).

---

## What changed

### 1) YouTube feed on the blog
A reusable component pulls the latest videos and (when there’s a matching post) links to the write-up.

```astro
<YouTubeFeed
  maxVideos={4}
  showTitle={true}
  showDescription={false}
  gridCols={2}
  channelId="UCtzNXx0YjJFvAuAPL9ZjQOw"
/>
````

**How it works**

* Fetch via YouTube RSS.
* Map videos to posts by `youtubeId` in post front matter.
* Show **“Read the blog post”** when there’s a match.
* Responsive grid with graceful fallbacks.

**Post front matter example**

```yaml
---
title: "X"
date: "2025-07-10"
updateDate: "2025-07-28"
youtubeId: "Qwo8ex0x_yE"
---
```

---

### 2) Clearer dates (Published • Updated)

Cards now show both timestamps when available:

**Before:** “2 years ago”
**After:** **Published 2 years ago • Updated 3 days ago**

```astro
<div class="date-info">
  {date && `Published ${formatDistance(new Date(date), new Date(), { addSuffix: true })}`}
  {updateDate && ` • Updated ${formatDistance(new Date(updateDate), new Date(), { addSuffix: true })}`}
</div>
```

Benefits: readers see freshness at a glance and trust the content more.

---

### 3) Smarter sorting (freshness first)

Updated posts float to the top automatically.

```ts
const allPosts = await getCollection("posts", ({ data }) => data.draft !== true)
  .then((res) =>
    res.sort((a, b) => {
      const aDate = new Date(a.data.updateDate ?? a.data.date);
      const bDate = new Date(b.data.updateDate ?? b.data.date);
      return bDate.getTime() - aDate.getTime();
    })
  );
```

---

## Visual polish

* Lighter description text for hierarchy.
* Consistent date formatting everywhere.
* Tighter spacing on cards for faster scanning.

---

## Result

* **Better discovery:** videos and write-ups sit together.
* **Freshness surfaced:** recent updates rise to the top.
* **Clear signals:** dates are explicit and consistent.

---

## What’s next

* Related content (posts ↔︎ videos).
* Search that includes video metadata.
* Analytics on which pairs (video + post) perform best.
